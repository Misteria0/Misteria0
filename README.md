<sub> I go by Misty 

<sub> **BYI**: I struggle with empathy so please don't vent to me. I can be insensitive so tell me when I'm being mean. I'm also bad at keeping conversations going so I prefer if you interact first. If I take long to respond it's because I don't have a response I am not ignoring you I just don't know what to say. Sometimes I usually miss jokes or don't understand a lot of things. Sorry if you interact with me and you need tone tags since I don't really know how to use them. 

<sub> **INT**: I like to hear forsaken hot takes so whisper me if you have any.

<sub> I go by Misty 

<sub> **BYI**:  I can be insensitive so tell me when I'm being mean or sum i dunno. Or I may just genuinly believe I didn't say anything wrong so mb. I'm  bad at keeping conversations going but I can start them. If I take long to respond it's because I don't have a response I am not ignoring you I just don't know what to say and most likely won't say anything after a while to figure out a good answer. Sometimes I usually miss jokes or don't understand a lot of things. Sorry if you interact with me and you need tone tags since I don't really know how to use them.

<sub> **INT**: I like to hear forsaken hot takes so whisper me if you have any. I also like talking to people so go ahead (Sometimes on not in the mood though)
